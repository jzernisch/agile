# notes-on-agile

These are personal [notes](notes.md) on Agile and Lean (in the context of software development). As I think that the various Agile and Lean methodologies and frameworks all share the same core ideas, I try to extract and condense those here.

As a forgetful person, I'm also experimenting here how to manage my knowledge using version control. As learning is a both [iterative and incremental](notes.md#iterative-and-incremental-development) process, Git should be a good fit.
