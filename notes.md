# Notes On Agile

## Validated Learning

- In domains with high uncertainty, we have to base our decisions on assumptions. 
- The longer an assumption stays invalidated, the more decisions may potentially depend on that assumption, and thus may be proven wrong if the assumption turns out to be invalid. 
- In order to minimize risk, we should validate assumptions as fast as possible.
