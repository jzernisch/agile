# Notes On Agile

## Uncertainty and Variability

- Domains where existing products are _repeated_ (like manufacturing) have a low degree of uncertainty.
- Domains where _unique_ products are _created_ (like product development) have a high degree of uncertainty:
  - What do build? Markets and thus requirements change over time, and even if they don't, we cant't know the details upfront.
  - How to build it (which technologies to use)?
- People are highly variable (as they are individuals), which of course is independent of any domain.
- Variablity is inevitable and thus need to be managed. Embracing it enables us to maximize business value.

## Validating Assumptions

- In domains with high uncertainty, we have to base our decisions on assumptions. 
- The longer an assumption stays invalidated, the more decisions may potentially depend on that assumption, and thus may be proven wrong if the assumption turns out to be invalid. 
- In order to minimize waste, we should validate assumptions as fast as possible by gathering [feedback](#feedback). 
- By deferring decisions to the latest possible moment, we can "keep options open", meaning avoiding potential dependencies on our decision that make it hard to revert later.
- Less WIP leads to shorter cycle times, which in turn leads to faster [feedback](#feedback) on our assumptions.

## Defined vs Empirical Process Control

- Defined Process Control relies on prediction of the things involved in the process and defines it accordingly, assuming the environment is predictiable (low variability and uncertainty).
- Empirical Process Control relies on continuous inspection and adaptation of the things involved in the process, assuming the environment is unpredictable (high variabilty and uncertainty).

## Feedback

- Feedback can be used to validate or invalidate assumptions empirically. 
- We get feedback on a product by using it (preferably by the people who it is built for).
