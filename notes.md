# Notes On Agile

## Validating Assumptions

- In domains with high uncertainty, we have to base our decisions on assumptions. 
- The longer an assumption stays invalidated, the more decisions may potentially depend on that assumption, and thus may be proven wrong if the assumption turns out to be invalid. 
- In order to minimize risk, we should validate assumptions as fast as possible. 
- By deferring decisions to the latest possible moment, we can "keep options open", meaning avoiding potential dependencies on our decision that make it hard to revert later.
- Less WIP leads to shorter cycle times, which in turn leads to faster feedback on our assumptions.
